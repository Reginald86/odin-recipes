        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup walnuts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&#8457. Grease and flour a bread loaf pan (9.25 long x 5.25
            wide x 2.75 deep).  Lightly roast walnuts on a skillet, continuously stirring so they 
            won't burn.  Coarsely chop and cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, cream together 8 Tbsp softened butter and 3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>Mash bananas with a fork until the consistency of chunky applesauce and add
            them to the batter along with 2 eggs, mixing until blended.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together: 1-1/2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of baking soda
            and 1/2 tsp of salt.  After whisking, add to batter.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and mix in chopped walnuts and raisins.  Pour into
            prepared loaf pan.  Bake at 350&#8457 for 55-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted 
            into the center comes out nearly clean.  Let banana bread rest for 10 minutes before
            transferring to a wire rack.
        </li>
    </ol>
